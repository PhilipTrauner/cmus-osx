# cmus-osx

`cmus-osx` is a tiny set of three `python` scripts to control `cmus`<sup>[note](#cmus)</sup> from `OS X`:

### media keys
links media keys of a Mac to `cmus`:

### notification center
optionally, links `cmus` to `OS X` notification center:

> [vim-cmus](https://github.com/azadkuh/vim-cmus) is a sister project for `vim` integration of `cmus`.


## setup
after cloning this repository, simply find `setup.py`:
```bash
# on cmus-osx directory
cmus-osx/> ./setup.py install

# to uninstall
cmus-osx/> ./setup.py uninstall

```

## usage
in your console, just launch `cmus-osx.py` instead of `cmus`:
```bash
$> cmus-osx.py
```

now everything (media keys and notification center) should just works.

## dependencies
in order to use `cmus-osx` you need:

- `OS X` and `cmus`!
```bash
$> brew install cmus
```

- [`pyobjc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyObjC) as `python` and `objective-c` bridge.
```bash
$> pip install -U pyobjc
```

## under the hood
a quick introduction about what these scripts do:

### installation detail
on installation, the `setup.py`:

- copies three python scripts from [`./bin/`](./bin/) directory to `/usr/local/bin/` (as default installation path).
 this path is defined is [`setup.py`](./setup.py), edit to your favorite value.
- tries to configure `cmus` to use notification center script by modifying: `~/.config/cmus/autosave`.


### scripts

#### key watcher
[`./bin/cmus-osx-keys.py`](./bin/cmus-osx-keys.py)

- unloads the `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist` agent to release media keys from itunes.
- listens for media key press, and remotely controls `cmus`

#### status notification
[`./bin/cmus-osx-notify.py`](./bin/cmus-osx-notify.py)

this script parses input arguments from `cmus` and makes notifications.
(`cmus` can be configured to run an external app to notify about status changes.)

#### main launcher
[`./bin/cmus-osx.py`](./bin/cmus-osx.py)

- launches key watcher and then `cmus` itself
- closes key watcher on `cmus` exit or termination
- tries to revert the media keys control back to `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist`


## troubleshooting

### media keys
after normally quitting from `cmus` (which had been called by `cmus-osx.py` internally),
 the control of media key will be set to default. so the `itunes` should be called immediately after
 you press *play* or â€¦ button.

if for any reason media keys fail to launch `itunes`:
```bash
$> launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist
```

> please note that `unload` just takes the control off from `itunes`

### forcefully terminate
on some rare occasions `cmus` refused to respond to any input and just hangs,
 esp. playing files from a lost `cifs`/`smb` mounted folder or after resuming from *Sleep Mode*.

in such cases you may like to use:
```bash
$> ps aux | grep cmus
$> kill -SIGKILL __cmus_process_id__
```
